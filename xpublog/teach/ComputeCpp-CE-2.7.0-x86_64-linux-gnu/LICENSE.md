ARM Limited

Software Grant License Agreement ("Agreement")

Except for the license granted herein to you, ARM Limited ("ARM") reserves all
right, title, and interest in and to the Software (defined below).

Definition

"Software" means the code and documentation as well as any original work of
authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that
is intentionally submitted by ARM to llvm.org (http://llvm.org) ("LLVM") for
inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by LLVM
(the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of
electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to LLVM or its
representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are
managed by, or on behalf of, LLVM for the purpose of discussing and improving
the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked otherwise.

1. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   Agreement, ARM hereby grants to you and to recipients of the Software
   distributed by LLVM a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
   royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative
   works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Software and such derivative works.

2. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   Agreement, ARM hereby grants you and to recipients of the Software
   distributed by LLVM a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
   royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license
   to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
   the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by ARM that are necessarily infringed by ARM's Software alone or by
   combination of the Software with the Work to which such Software was
   submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against ARM or any
   other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
   that ARM's Software, or the Work to which ARM has contributed constitutes
   direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
   to that entity under this Agreement for the Software or Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, the software is
provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
