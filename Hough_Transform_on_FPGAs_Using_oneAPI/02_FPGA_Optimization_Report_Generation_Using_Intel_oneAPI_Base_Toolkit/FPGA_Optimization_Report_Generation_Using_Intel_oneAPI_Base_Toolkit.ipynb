    "Due to pointer aliasing, the compiler must be conservative about optimizations that reorder, parallelize, or overlap operations that could alias. You should apply the DPC++ [[intel::kernel_args_restrict]] kernel attribute any time you can guarantee that kernel arguments do not alias. This attribute enables more aggressive compiler optimizations and often improves kernel performance on FPGA. C and OpenCL programmers may recognize this concept as the __restrict__ keyword. Refer to the [kernel_args_restrict](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/DirectProgramming/DPC%2B%2BFPGA/Tutorials/Features/kernel_args_restrict) tutorial for more information about this feature.\n",

    "For each private or local array in your DPC++ FPGA device code, the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler creates a custom memory system in your program's datapath to contain the contents of that array. Memory attributes are a set of DPC++ extensions for FPGAs that enable you to override the compiler's internal heuristics and to control the architecture of kernel memory. One of these attributes or techniques is known as __banking__. \n",
    "\n",
    "Banks are structures that have independent ports from the rest of the memory structure, but that only contain a portion of the contents. For example, if you created two banks, one bank contains half of the data and the other bank contains the other half of the data, each half can be read independently. Specifying the numbanks (N) and bankwidth (M) memory attributes allow users to configure the local memory banks for parallel memory accesses. The banking geometry described by these attributes determines which elements of the local memory system your kernel can access in parallel. Refer to the [memory_attributes](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/DirectProgramming/DPC%2B%2BFPGA/Tutorials/Features/memory_attributes) tutorial for more information about this feature.\n",
