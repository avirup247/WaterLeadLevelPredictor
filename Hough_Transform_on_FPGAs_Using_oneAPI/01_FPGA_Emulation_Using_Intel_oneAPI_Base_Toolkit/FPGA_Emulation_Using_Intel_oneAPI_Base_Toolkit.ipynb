    "\n",
    "The Hough Transform is a feature extraction technique used in computer vision applications. After processing an image with an edge-detection algorithm such as a Sobel filter, you are left with a monochrome (black/white) image. This technique is further useful for many detection algorithms to consider the image as a set of lines. However, an image of black and white pixels is not a convenient or useful representation of these lines to algorithms such as object detection. The Hough Transform technique transforms pixels to a set of “line votes.”\n",

The FPGA device image generation process can take hours to complete.

However, this method relies heavily on the compiler to verify that new changes introduced do not affect the device image previously generated. Alternatively, you can use __the device link__ method which involves manually splitting host and kernel(device) code into separate files, compiling, and linking at the end.
