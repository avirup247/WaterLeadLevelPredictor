    "After validating functionality and optimizing design, the next stage is to generate the FPGA bitstream (binary) and run it on the FPGA. The Intel® Quartus® Prime software maps the Verilog RTL specifying the design's circuit topology onto the FPGA's sea of primitive hardware resources. The Intel® Quartus® Prime software is included in the Intel® FPGA Add-On for oneAPI Base Toolkit, which is required for this compilation stage. The result is an FPGA hardware binary (also referred to as a bitstream). This compilation process takes hours. You can target one of the following Intel® Programmable Acceleration Cards (PAC) or a custom platform board:\n",

The optimization report generated here (sometimes called the \"__static report__\") contains significant information about how the compiler has transformed your DPC++ device code into an FPGA design. The report contains visualizations of structures generated on the FPGA, performance and expected performance bottleneck information, and estimated resource utilization.\n",

    "The FPGA bitstream compilation stage is the final piece to getting your designs on the FPGA. By taking advantage of the Intel® DevCloud environment, you can easily specify hardware platforms and target FPGA products for running their algorithms. Reports generated in this stage are also more detailed providing closer-to-hardware insight on performance, latency, and data bottlenecks. "
