# Hough Transform with FPGAs Using Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit

The FPGA development flow Using Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit and Intel® FPGA Add-on for oneAPI Base Toolkit for a user application.  
It uses an in-house, unoptimized Hough Transform algorithm and follows a series of SYCL optimization techniques for making the design performant on the FPGA hardware.
